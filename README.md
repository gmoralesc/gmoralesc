# Hi, I am Gustavo Morales

Senior Software Engineer with a Bachelor's in Computer Science, a Master's in IT Governance, and extensive experience in software development. I am passionate about coding, teaching, and mentoring, which has led me to teach undergraduate and graduate courses in web development, author books on JavaScript and Node.js, and create awesomenodejs.dev, a resource hub for developers. I combine technical expertise with a strong commitment to knowledge-sharing through content creation on different platforms
